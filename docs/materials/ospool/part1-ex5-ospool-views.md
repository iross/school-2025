# OSPool Exercise 1.5 (Optional): Viewing OSPool Information

As a final — and completely optional — step in our exploration of the OSPool,
we invite you to look at some of the views on the OSPool that we provide publicly
for funding agencies, researchers, capacity contributors, and even ourselves.
Maybe these views will help you better understand the scope and dynamic nature of the OSPool.

## Maps

You have seen at least one map of OSPool contributors so far.
Where do these maps come from?

Please visit [https://map.osg-htc.org/](https://map.osg-htc.org/).

*   From the View drop-down menu, try different options.
*   The default “OSG Sites” view is not well defined… maybe don’t think too hard about that one!
*   CC* refers to the NSF Campus Cyberinfrastructure program,
    which has funded (as you can see) many sites that contribute to the OSPool.
*   You will learn more about the “Open Science Data Federation” (or OSDF) on Wednesday

## Projects

You can explore some information about research projects that have used the OSPool:

Please visit [https://osg-htc.org/services/ospool/projects.html](https://osg-htc.org/services/ospool/projects.html);
be patient, these pages get live data and take a while to fully load.
As the page says, the data is for projects that ran at least 100 jobs in the OSPool in the past year.

*   Note that most projects are named after the home institution and last name of the project PI.
    For example, `FIU_Li` is a project based at Florida International University, and t​​he PI is Jun Li.
*   Often, the PI is not the person running jobs, but rather students and post-docs.
    Continuing the `FIU_Li` example, Professor Li is not running these jobs…
    but the person who is running them is right here in the auditorium with us!
    Who is it?!?
*    Scroll down to see a table of projects; click on a project name to learn more about that project.

## CE Dashboard

For a view from the capacity contributor’s perspective,
we have a new feature called the “CE Dashboard” —
the name comes from the HTCondor-CE, from which the source data is collected.

Please visit [https://ce-dashboard.ospool.osg-htc.org/index.html](https://ce-dashboard.ospool.osg-htc.org/index.html).

*   Click on a CE name to see information about the past 2 weeks of contributions
    (for a local example, scroll down and try “CHTC-Spark-CE1”).
*   You can see information about the recent history
    of CPU, memory, and disk contributions and allocations to researcher jobs.
*   Scroll down to see information about projects (as in the previous section) that ran on the site.
*   There is too much information to describe here, but if you are interested in this view,
    talk to the staff, especially Tim C. who uses the CE Dashboard daily.
