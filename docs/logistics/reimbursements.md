# Getting Reimbursed for Expenses

If you paid for certain expenses to attend the OSG School 2024,
then we will reimburse you for them.
This page explains what can be reimbursed and how to request reimbursement.
Please read **this whole page carefully** before submitting your request.

**The deadline for all reimbursement submissions is <span style="color: #FF6600;">Friday, 20 September 2024</span>.**

## What Can Be Reimbursed?

We offered to reimburse certain expenses that were part of attending the OSG School:

-   Bus fare to/from Madison
-   Taxi or ride-share to/from Madison airport
-   Driving mileage (if prearranged)
-   Dinners Monday through Thursday (up to $35 per dinner)

Generally, we are not able to reimburse you for any other expenses
(e.g., checked baggage fees, transportation to/from your home and local airport).
However, if we made specific arrangements with you before the School,
those arrangements are still valid for reimbursement.
When in doubt, contact us well before the deadline.

## What Information Is Needed?

The University of Wisconsin–Madison has strict requirements about reimbursements.
See below for each type of expense and its rules.

Rides in your home town are not covered.</p><p>If you paid for other School participants, list their names. If the total (fare + tip) is more than $25, the original receipt is required, ideally including:</p><ul><li>Date of trip</li><li>Fare and tip</li></ul> |
| <p>Driving mileage</p> | <p>If we agreed in advance to cover your driving costs to/from the School, simply list the agreed-upon reimbursement amount ($ or miles) as a reminder.</p> |

Remember, all of your meal reimbursements are being paid by federal taxpayer funds, so be fair and honest! |

For other expense types that were arranged before the School, contact us to learn what documentation is required.

**Note:** If you must give us receipts (see above), electronic files are fine.
You may scan or photograph any paper receipts and email them to us.
