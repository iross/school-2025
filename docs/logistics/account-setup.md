# Apply for Computing Access

We will be using two different Access Points during the OSG School - 
`ap40.uw.osg-htc.org` and `ap1.facility.path-cc.io`. 

As soon as possible please request your account access using this link: [OSG School Account Registration](https://registry.cilogon.org/registry/co_petitions/start/coef:496)

Instructions on setting up your account can be found using this guide: 
[Log in to uw.osg-htc.org Access Points](https://portal.osg-htc.org/documentation/overview/account_setup/ap7-access/)

We strongly recommend going through the registration process and trying to 
log in **before** the School, ideally before your OSG orientation session. 

If you run into problems 
contact us at [support@osg-htc.org](mailto:support@osg-htc.org).
